The python code "Model-RCP-ode-monthly.py" produces times series of coral biomass, coral energy investment trait and symbiont biomass. 
The simulation takes as input several parameters that defined within code and timeseries of monthly temperature scenarios from an input file of the type ".dat".
The data for timeseries monthly temperature are available at (...)
The results of the simulation are saved in a predefined folder corresponding to each scenario, e.g. RESULTS/RCP26/. 
These folders must be defined before running the code.
